    "<h3>Direct Observations and Problems</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **experience** variable may represent skill progression and could be useful in predicting playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **hashedEmail** variable appears to be the unique player identifier, but is not relevant for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **played_hours** variable contains many zeros, possibly representing new players who have not yet begun playing; hwoever, this might affect our later prediction in answering the question based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **gender** variable contains has many different responses, such as “Other”, “Two-Spirited”, “Prefer not to say”, etc. This might make it hard to group or summarize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Age** variable has some missing values, which must be handled before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Other Potential Issue</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data may not represent all types of players (for example, older players or casual players may be missing).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Data by self-recording (such as age) may contain errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>How the Data be Collected</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data about how people play video games. They have set up a Minecraft serverLinks to an external site., and players' actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. </p >"

By focusing on these variables and removing missing values in Age, I can examine how playtime and age differ between subscribers and non-subscribers."
