    "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n",
    "A research group in the Department of Computer Science at UBC has set up a Minecraft server to study how people play video games. They collect data in two main data frames: players.csv, which contains a list of all unique players along with demographic and player-level information, and sessions.csv, which records individual play sessions for each player, including session-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the first dataset, players.csv, and investigate the question: “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between different types of players?\"\n",
    "Finally, we decided to predict whether the players' subscribe the Video Game based on their age and played time.\n",

    "+ **Experience:** character variable. It shows the players experience level. The categories — “Amateur,” “Regular,” “Veteran,” and “Pro” — indicate increasing levels of game proficiency in that order, and it could be useful in predicting playtime\n",

    "the player did not subscribe the game.\n",

    "+ **hashedEmail:** character variable. It is a anonnymized version of the player's email, but is not relevant for analysis.\n",

    "+ **played_hours :** numeric variable. It shows the number of hours the player has spent on the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **name:** character variable. It is the display name chosen by each player in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **gender:** character variable. It contains has many different responses, such as “Other”, “Two-Spirited”, “Prefer not to say”, etc, showing the gender of each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Age：** numeric variable. It shows the player's age. It has some missing values, which must be handled before modelling\n",

    "<h3>Other Potential Issue</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data may not represent all types of players (for example, older players or casual players may be missing).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Data by self-recording (such as age) may contain errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Age variable contains NA values. This may cause errors in many functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The hashedEmail variable is not human-readable, it may be useless.\n",

    "By comparing the overlap between the two groups of the histograms, we can see a clear pattern in the age distribution: subscribers tend to be younger, with most of them falling between 13 and 17 years old. A similar pattern appears in the playtime distribution. Subscribers are more concentrated in the lower playtime range, especially between 0 and 5 total hours. This suggests that players who subscribe to the newsletter are generally newer or lighter users of the server."
